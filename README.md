# eternal-cycler

An autonomous PR builder/reviewer loop for [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) agents. Install it as a git subtree in your repository to get:

- An autonomous agent loop that writes code, opens PRs, reviews them, and iterates until the reviewer approves
- An ExecPlan lifecycle system that enforces structured planning, verification gates, and escalation bounds
- An ExecPlan hook framework for repo-specific pre/post-action checks

```

The skill directory (`.agents/skills/eternal-cycler/`) is static and never written to by agents at runtime. All dynamic output goes to `eternal-cycler-out/`.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `git` | version control |
| `gh` | GitHub CLI for PR operations |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI (the agent runner) |
| `jq` | JSON parsing in loop scripts |
| `rg` | ripgrep for fast file search |

## Installation

Add eternal-cycler as a git subtree under `.agents/skills/eternal-cycler/`:

```bash
git subtree add \
  --prefix .agents/skills/eternal-cycler \
  https://github.com/SoraSuegami/eternal-cycler.git \
  main \
  --squash
```

Then run setup to copy the default hooks and create the output directories:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/eternal-cycler/setup.sh
```

Setup output:

```
[setup] eternal-cycler path: .agents/skills/eternal-cycler/
[setup] git repo root:       /path/to/your-repo/

[setup] OK  git found
[setup] OK  gh found
[setup] OK  codex found
[setup] OK  jq found
[setup] OK  rg found

[setup] Copying default ExecPlan hooks to /path/to/your-repo/.agents/skills/
[setup] OK   copied execplan-hook-pre-creation -> .agents/skills/execplan-hook-pre-creation
[setup] OK   copied execplan-hook-post-creation -> .agents/skills/execplan-hook-post-creation
[setup] OK   copied execplan-hook-resume -> .agents/skills/execplan-hook-resume
[setup] OK   copied execplan-hook-post-completion -> .agents/skills/execplan-hook-post-completion

[setup] OK   copied execplan-hook-tooling -> .agents/skills/execplan-hook-tooling
[setup] OK   copied execplan-sandbox-escalation -> .agents/skills/execplan-sandbox-escalation

[setup] Creating eternal-cycler-out/ output directories under /path/to/your-repo/
[setup] OK   eternal-cycler-out/plans/active
[setup] OK   eternal-cycler-out/plans/completed
[setup] OK   eternal-cycler-out/plans/tech-debt
[setup] OK   eternal-cycler-out/prs/active
[setup] OK   eternal-cycler-out/prs/completed

[setup] Setup complete.
[setup] Skill directory:  /path/to/your-repo/.agents/skills/
[setup] Output directory: /path/to/your-repo/eternal-cycler-out/
[setup] To start the builder/reviewer loop:
[setup]   .agents/skills/eternal-cycler/scripts/run_builder_reviewer_loop.sh \
[setup]     --task 'describe the task here'
```

Commit the result:

```bash
git add .agents/ eternal-cycler-out/
git commit -m "chore: install eternal-cycler"
```

## Usage

The skill is invoked as a Codex skill. When running Codex in your repository with `.agents/skills/eternal-cycler/SKILL.md` in scope, the agent will run the builder/reviewer loop automatically.

You can also invoke the loop directly:

```bash
# New task (run from a feature branch; the loop uses the current branch)
git switch -c feat/my-task
.agents/skills/eternal-cycler/scripts/run_builder_reviewer_loop.sh \
  --task "add input validation to the login form"

# Resume an existing PR
.agents/skills/eternal-cycler/scripts/run_builder_reviewer_loop.sh \
  --task-file task.md \
  --pr-url https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/42
```

See `SKILL.md` for the full invocation contract that the Codex agent follows.

## Updating

Pull upstream changes with git subtree:

```bash
git subtree pull \
  --prefix .agents/skills/eternal-cycler \
  https://github.com/SoraSuegami/eternal-cycler.git \
  main \
  --squash
```

Re-run setup after updating to pick up any new default hooks:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/eternal-cycler/setup.sh
```

Existing hook directories in `.agents/skills/` are overwritten so that updates from eternal-cycler are always applied.

## Adding custom hooks

The gate script resolves hook scripts from `.agents/skills/` in your repository. To add a new hook for a `hook_events` entry:

1. Pick an event ID, for example `hook.your_event`.
   Legacy `action.*` event IDs are rejected.
2. Derive the hook directory name from the portion after the first `.` by replacing `_` and `.` with `-`.
   `hook.your_event` becomes `.agents/skills/execplan-hook-your-event/`.
3. Create that directory with a `scripts/run_event.sh` that outputs `STATUS=pass` or `STATUS=fail`.
4. When authoring an ExecPlan `Progress` action, search the installed skill index for `execplan-hook-*` hooks and write the corresponding event ID into `hook_events`.

See `assets/default-hooks/execplan-hook-tooling/` for an example hook.
