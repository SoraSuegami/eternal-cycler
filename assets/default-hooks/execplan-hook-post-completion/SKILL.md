# Hook: execplan.post_completion

This hook executes the "after main ExecPlan completion" workflow:

- validate ledger completion prerequisites,
- resolve linked PR tracking document from the plan and verify metadata,
- ensure no unresolved progress actions or unresolved latest hook events remain,
- verify start snapshot markers are present in the plan,
- do not run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` in this event,
- if validation fails, roll back the plan document to active path and return to action revision flow.

Execution policy:

- This event must be executed out-of-sandbox.
- Run through gate as: `scripts/execplan_gate.sh --plan <completed_plan_md> --event execplan.post_completion` with out-of-sandbox execution.
- Do not run this event inside sandbox because stable `gh` access is required.

## Script

- `scripts/run_event.sh --plan <plan_md>`
