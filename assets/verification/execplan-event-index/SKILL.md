# ExecPlan Event Index

This skill is the event registry for ExecPlan verification.

## Purpose

Resolve an `event_id` to the exact repository-local event skill and script that executes it.

## Registry file

Read this file first:

- `references/event_skill_map.tsv`

Format (tab-separated):

1. `event_id`
2. `skill_dir`
3. `script_relpath`

## Mandatory lifecycle events

The registry must always include:

- `execplan.pre_creation`
- `execplan.post_completion`

## Evolution rule

Action events may be added/removed by editing `references/event_skill_map.tsv` and creating/removing corresponding event skill directories under `assets/verification/`.

## Out-of-sandbox command rule

When running event scripts, if a command requires out-of-sandbox execution, `assets/verification/execplan-sandbox-escalation/SKILL.md` is mandatory and must be used first:

- check `assets/verification/execplan-sandbox-escalation/references/allowed_command_prefixes.md`,
- prefer existing prefixes whenever feasible,
- if a new command is required, request human approval and add a safely generalized prefix to that reference file.
